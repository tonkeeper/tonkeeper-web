# Icons to revisit

Icons in `svg/` that were reconstructed from Figma MCP asset fragments rather than exported through
Figma's _Export → SVG_ panel. They should render identically, but sub-pixel rounding, masks, or
compound paths may differ. Verify each against a fresh Figma SVG export before considering it
"done"; overwrite the file and re-run `yarn workspace @tonkeeper/ui-kit icons`.

Remove an entry from this list once the SVG has been replaced (or visually diffed and confirmed)
against an authoritative Figma export.

Baked into the SVG as `transform="matrix(0 -1 1 0 2 12.75)"`. If the rendered icon points the wrong direction or sits in the wrong half of the box, this is the first thing to check |
