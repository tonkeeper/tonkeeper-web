tab#### Mac Environment variables:

You can generate an App Store Connect API key to authenticate `notarytool` by going to the
[App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api) access page and using the "Keys"
tab. This API key will look something like `AuthKey_ABCD123456.p8` and can only be downloaded once.
